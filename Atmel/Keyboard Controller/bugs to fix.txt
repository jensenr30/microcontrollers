This is a really stupid problem: I forgot to change the ports in the case. THEY ARE ALL PORTD.
I will need to change those in the future.
I would change them right now, but I don't have time to go through testing this after I change it.
I don't want to break the code by "fixing a little error" and then never test the code.
Next thing I know I'm trying to interpret a keyboard in a dark alley and BOOM.
It doesn't work.
And somebody stabbed me.
It's a dangerous place.
It's a DANGEROUS place.

//clock data into the register.
		switch(port){
			case 'b':
			case 'B':
				PORTD &= ~(1 << clockPin);
				PORTD |=  (1 << clockPin);
				break;
			case 'c':
			case 'C':
				PORTD &= ~(1 << clockPin);
				PORTD |=  (1 << clockPin);
				break;
			case 'd':
			case 'D':
				PORTD &= ~(1 << clockPin);
				PORTD |=  (1 << clockPin);
				break;
			default:
				break;
		}
