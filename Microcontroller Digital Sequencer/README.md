Microcontroller-Based-Sequencer
===============================

[Google Docs project record](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IsLHIiJiteomPVezowRE7Sfm5xE44JpBsXNlwfGwIHg/edit)


Junior Design Project - 2013/2014 school year

The purpose of this project is to use a microcontroller to control/generate sounds and noises. The device will work as a sequencer. It will be able to sequence 8 or so sounds. The ATmega328P is being used as the brains of the microcontroller for the time being. I am planning on using ATtiny24A microcontrollers as peripheral devices for the ATmega328P. I may write a program for one of them that makes a noise signal.
