jensen comments: so it seems like a note is being added, and the XPhone takes issue with this note being added.
The problem I observed is that the XPhone only plays half of the notes (and keeps spitting out that error).
I don't understand why it is even possible for me to get the "you are already playing this note" error because 
the cooldown period is longer than any solenoid power.

Also, why would that make the song stop?
I thought I already fixed an issue like this in the song playback...
